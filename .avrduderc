# There is a ATmega328P kit PCB called "uncompatino".
# This board allows ISP via its on-board FT232R.
# This is designed like Arduino Duemilanove but has no standard ICPS header.
# Its 4 pairs of pins are shorted to enable ftdi_syncbb.

# TTL-232R GND 1 Black  -> ICPS GND   (6 pin)
# TTL-232R CTS 2 Brown  -> ICPS MOSI  (4 pin)
# TTL-232R VCC 3 Red    -> ICPS VCC   (2 pin)
# TTL-232R TXD 4 Orange -> ICPS RESET (5 pin)
# TTL-232R RXD 5 Yellow -> ICPS SCK   (3 pin)
# TTL-232R RTS 6 Green  -> ICPS MISO  (1 pin)
# Except for VCC and GND, you can connect arbitual pairs as long as 
# the following table is adjusted.
